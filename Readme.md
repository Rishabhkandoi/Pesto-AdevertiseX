## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a data engineering solution for AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company specializing in programmatic advertising. The solution addresses data ingestion, processing, storage, query optimization, error handling, and monitoring requirements for ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests.

## 2. Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data_ingestion/`: Contains scripts for data ingestion and validation.
- `data_processing/`: Contains scripts for data transformation, correlation, deduplication, and enrichment.
- `data_storage/`: Provides information on data storage solutions and ETL scripts.
- `query_performance_optimization/`: Offers details on indexing, partitioning, and aggregation strategies.
- `error_handling_and_monitoring/`: Includes scripts for detecting data anomalies and log-based error handling.
- `dependencies.txt`: Lists the required libraries and tools.
- `documentation/`: Contains architecture diagrams and data flow documentation.
- `sample_data/`: Includes small samples of data in various formats for testing and development.
- `config/`: Provides configuration files for different components.

## 3. Data Ingestion

**Suggestion:** 
1. **Real-Time vs. Batch Ingestion:** Consider whether you need real-time or batch ingestion. Real-time ingestion can be achieved using technologies like Apache Kafka, while batch processing can be done with tools like Apache NiFi.

2. **Data Formats:** Use tools that can handle various data formats efficiently. For JSON data, you can use JSON libraries or frameworks. For Avro, consider using Apache Avro tools for parsing.

3. **Scaling:** Ensure the ingestion system is scalable. Tools like Apache Kafka can help you handle high data volumes efficiently.

4. **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to check for data quality and integrity. You can use JSON schema validation for JSON data and schema-on-read validation for Avro data.

**Implementation:**
- **Ingestion Process:**
  - Real-time: Use Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion.
  - Batch: Consider Apache NiFi for batch data ingestion.
- **Data Validation:**
  - Implement JSON schema validation for JSON data.
  - Use Avro schema-on-read validation for Avro data.

## 4. Data Processing

**Suggestion:** 
1. **Data Transformation:** Use Apache Spark for data transformation. It provides a highly scalable and efficient way to process large datasets. Leverage Spark SQL for structured data processing.
2. **Data Validation, Filtering, and Deduplication:** Implement data validation rules to ensure data quality. Use filtering to exclude irrelevant data, and implement deduplication logic to remove duplicate records.
3. **Correlation:** Use techniques like joining, aggregating, and windowing functions in Spark SQL to correlate data. This can help provide meaningful insights, especially when correlating ad impressions with clicks and conversions.

**Implementation:**
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Use Apache Spark for scalable data transformation.
  - Utilize Spark SQL for structured data processing.
- **Data Validation, Filtering, and Deduplication:**
  - Implement data validation rules.
  - Use Spark DataFrame operations for filtering and deduplication.
- **Correlation:**
  - Leverage Spark SQL for correlating ad impressions with clicks and conversions.

## 5. Data Storage

**Suggestion:** 
1. **Storage System Selection:** Choose a storage system that suits your needs. Hadoop HDFS is excellent for storing large volumes of data efficiently. Cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon S3 can also be considered.
2. **Schema Definition:** Define a schema for your processed data. For structured data, you can use tools like Apache Avro for schema definition. This helps with data organization and retrieval.
3. **ETL Jobs:** Develop ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs that efficiently load data into the chosen storage system. Apache Nifi and Apache Sqoop can be helpful for this.

**Implementation:**
- **Storage Selection:**
  - Consider Hadoop HDFS for efficient data storage.
  - Evaluate cloud-based solutions like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
- **Schema Definition:**
  - Use Apache Avro for structured data schema definition.
- **ETL Jobs:**
  - Develop ETL jobs to load data into the chosen storage system efficiently.

## 6. Query Performance Optimization

**Suggestion:**
1. **Indexing:** Create appropriate indexes on storage systems (e.g., Hive, Parquet) to speed up query performance. Spark SQL also allows you to create and use indexes.
2. **Partitioning:** Partition data to avoid full scans. Use a partition key relevant to your query patterns, e.g., by date, campaign ID, or user ID.
3. **Aggregations:** Precompute aggregations to improve query performance. Use Spark's built-in functions for aggregation, and store aggregated data in an optimized format like Parquet.

**Implementation:**
- **Indexing:**
  - Create indexes on storage systems like Hive or Parquet.
  - Utilize Spark SQL's ability to create and use indexes.
- **Partitioning:**
  - Partition data by a relevant key, such as date or campaign ID.
  - Take advantage of Spark's support for partitioned data.
- **Aggregations:**
  - Precompute aggregations using Spark's built-in functions.
  - Store aggregated data in an optimized format, like Parquet.

## 7. Error Handling and Monitoring

**Suggestion:**
1. **Monitoring Tools:** Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track the performance and health of your data pipeline. Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring.
2. **Alerting Mechanisms:** Configure alerting rules within Prometheus and Grafana to notify you in real-time when data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays occur. You can set thresholds for different metrics and receive alerts via various channels like email or Slack.

**Implementation:**
- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
  - Create dashboards to visualize data pipeline health.
- **Alerting Mechanisms:**
  - Configure alerting rules in Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Set up thresholds and notifications for data quality issues.
