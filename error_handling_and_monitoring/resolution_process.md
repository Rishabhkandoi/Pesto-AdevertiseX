# Resolution Process for Data Quality Issues

In the event of data quality issues, it's essential to have a defined resolution process in place to maintain the effectiveness of your data pipeline. The following steps can be part of the resolution process:

1. **Detection:** Anomalies and discrepancies are detected using monitoring and alerting mechanisms, such as those configured in Prometheus and Grafana.

2. **Alerting:** Notifications are sent to responsible team members, including data engineers and analysts, when data quality issues are detected.

3. **Investigation:** The team investigates the root causes of the data quality issues. This may involve reviewing logs, examining data sources, and conducting in-depth analysis.

4. **Resolution:** Once the root causes are identified, the team takes necessary actions to resolve the issues. This may include cleaning and transforming data, fixing ingestion processes, or enhancing validation rules.

5. **Testing:** After resolution, it's crucial to perform thorough testing to ensure that the issues are resolved, and data quality is restored.

6. **Documentation:** Document the entire process, including detection, alerting, investigation, resolution, and testing. This documentation is valuable for future reference.

7. **Prevention:** Implement preventive measures to minimize the likelihood of data quality issues occurring again. This could involve process improvements, additional validation, or enhancing monitoring.

8. **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a post-incident review to evaluate the effectiveness of the resolution process and identify areas for improvement.

Having a well-defined resolution process helps maintain the reliability and accuracy of your data, ensuring that data quality issues are addressed promptly.
